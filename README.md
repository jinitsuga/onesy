# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- Thinking about features in components beforehand and then actually implementing them, BEFORE moving onto another component.
- backend/database structure planning.
- incorporating a new hook (useRef hook) to detect clicking outside of an element. useRef essentially allows us to select a DOM node of our choosing
  through the proper setup.
